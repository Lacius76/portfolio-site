# Anti-Gravity Portfolio – Senior UI/UX Showcase
This is the technical repository of my personal brand ecosystem. It demonstrates a high-performance, accessible, and multilingual approach to modern web design.

### 🛠️ Technical Highlights
- **Framework-less Efficiency:** Built with vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for maximum speed and SEO optimization.
- **AI-Augmented i18n:** Implemented a custom JSON-based internationalization system (English/German) managed through AI-driven workflows.
- **Responsive Architecture:** Mobile-first approach with complex CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts to handle long German compound words.
- **Branding:** Custom iconography developed in Affinity Designer, including adaptations from industrial UI standards (WinCC OA).

### 🤖 AI Workflow
The development process utilized **Gemini 3 Pro** for structural logic and **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for linguistic refinement, creating a seamless "AI-Human" collaboration.
